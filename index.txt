    Hi, I’m Ed Bayes. I’m a product designer with a background in policy & AI focused on harnessing autonomous systems to solve societal challenges.

	Currently, I lead on product policy & UI design at <a href="https://everydayrobots.com/">Everyday Robots</a> (born from <a href="https://x.company/">Google X</a>) where I design interfaces and help the team answer thorny ethical questions and so we can build safe and trustworthy products. I also hold an Adjunct Faculty position at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Parsons</a>s where I teach entrepreneurship and design.

      Previously, I co-founded <a href="https://goyonder.co.uk/">Yonder</a>, an award-winning startup that developed smart, simple tools to help low-income families improve their financial wellbeing in the UK, and worked in law and policy advising the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury">UK Treasury</a> on autonomous vehicles policy and set up a Directorate for the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/">Mayor of London</a> to support creative entrepreneurship in the capital.

   I grew up in South Wales and have been interested in technology and society for as long as I can remember. I studied <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Undergraduate/degree-programmes-2023/BA-Anthropology-and-Law">Law & Anthropology</a> at the London School of Economics (LSE) but as much as I enjoyed the social sciences, my true passion has always been making things for other people. So I decided to move into the field of product design by attending the <a href="https://mde.harvard.edu/">Design Engineering</a> graduate program at Harvard.

    If I’m not thinking about AI & design, I’m probably thinking about music. I’ve composed music for West End musicals and played in <a href="https://musicbyfriends.bandcamp.com/">bands</a> with international airplay. As Nina Simone says, "anything human can be felt through music!"
